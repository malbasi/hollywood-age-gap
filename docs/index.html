The #MeToo movement has brought widespread attention to the sexism embedded in the entertainment industry. Researchers and journalists have shown that the sexism extends to everything from characters’ speaking lines to the wages of behind-the-scenes employees. <br><br> To add to this growing body of work, we decided to take a closer look at how romantic relationships are depicted in films. Using data from Lynn Fisher’s <a href="https://github.com/lynnandtonic/hollywood-age-gap">Hollywood Age Gap project</a>, which has catalogued over a thousand couples in 730 movies, we explored how age and gender are broken down in relationships on screen. <br><br><br> <img src="/hollywood-age-gap/angela-filmstrip-draft-2.5e096696.gif" <br=""><br> It’s worth noting that the data aren’t comprehensive. Films are added to Fisher’s database by user submission and don’t reflect the entire output of Hollywood. Age difference is determined by the age of each actor upon filming, and appearances can be deceptive. But we hope our analysis reveals something about the romantic norms of the movie industry. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-5 mb-5"> <div class="col-sm-12"> <h1>Every romance, every age</h1> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-5 mb-5"> <div class="col-lg-8 sticky"> <div id="chart-2"></div> </div> <div class="col-lg-4"> <div class="step" id="intro"></div> <div class="step" id="older-men"> <p>Here’s what the age distribution of every romance looks like.

Under these parameters, Woody Allen topped the list, with an average age gap of 20 years in his films. So did British directors John Glen and Lewis Gilbert, thanks to the James Bond franchise.
