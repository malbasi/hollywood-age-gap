The #MeToo movement has brought widespread attention to the sexism embedded in the entertainment industry. Researchers and journalists have shown that the sexism extends to everything from characters’ speaking lines to the wages of behind-the-scenes employees. <br><br> To add to this growing body of work, we decided to take a closer look at how romantic relationships are depicted in films. Using data from Lynn Fisher’s <a href="https://github.com/lynnandtonic/hollywood-age-gap">Hollywood Age Gap project</a>, which has catalogued over a thousand couples in 730 movies, we explored how age and gender are broken down in relationships on screen. <br><br><br> <img src="/hollywood-age-gap/filmstrip-draft-2.5e096696.gif" <br=""><br> It’s worth noting that the data aren’t comprehensive. Films are added to Fisher’s database by user submission and don’t reflect the entire output of Hollywood. Age difference is determined by the age of each actor upon filming, and appearances can be deceptive. But we hope our analysis reveals something about the romantic norms of the movie industry. </p> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-5 mb-5"> <div class="col-sm-12"> <h1>Every romance, every age</h1> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-5 mb-5"> <div class="col-lg-8 sticky"> <form id="form-movies" style="font:14px arial"> <input type="text" id="tbMovies" placeholder="Search for a movie"> <input type="submit" value="Submit"></form> <div id="chart-2"></div> </div> <div class="col-lg-4"> <div class="step" id="intro"></div> <div class="step" id="older-men"> <p>Here’s what the age distribution of every romance looks like.

We searched for the five directors with the highest average age gaps over their bodies of work, amongst individuals who had directed at least three movies. Under these parameters, Woody Allen topped the list, with an average age gap of 20 years in his films. British directors John Glen and Lewis Gilbert also made the cut, thanks to the James Bond franchise.

Well-known actors with long careers, like Tom Cruise and Johnny Depp, were close in age with their love interests in their early roles — but as they became older, they continued to be cast with young women. A widening age gap appears to be the norm for most famous male actors who act through middle age and beyond. Here are the ages four prominent male actors plotted against the ages of the actresses they were cast with, over time: </p> </div> </div> <div class="col-sm-12" align="center"> <h1>How age gaps shift over an actor's career</h1> </div>  <div class="row mt-5 mb-5" align="center"> <div id="men-chart"></div> </div> <div class="row mt-5 mb-5"> <div class="offset-2 col-sm-8 mt-5 mb-5"> <p> The Hollywood Age Gap project most obviously reveals one thing: that the entertainment industry appears to favor straight relationships with an older male partner — and often this norm is exaggerated with wide age disparities between actors. But whether the trend is reflective of a special Hollywood brand of chauvinism is unclear; because the data is imperfect, the results can’t be used to make sweeping conclusions of movie industry bias. Regardless, it’s safe to say that heteronormativity abounds. </p> </div> </div>   <script src="/hollywood-age-gap/images.9452d136.js"></script> <script src="/hollywood-age-gap/images2.986ab2f7.js"></script> <script scr="chart-hall.js"></script> <script src="/hollywood-age-gap/01-chart.28fc3fbb.js"></script> <script src="/hollywood-age-gap/02-chart.bff04528.js"></script>  <script src="/hollywood-age-gap/men-chart.d9973cde.js"></script> <script src="/hollywood-age-gap/scrollytelling.9883f899.js"></script> </div></div></body> </html>
